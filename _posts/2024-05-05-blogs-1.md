## 1. Overview

njRAT is a remote access tool (RAT) with a graphical user interface (gui) that allows the operator to hijack victim’s machine for keylogging, screenshot capture, file manipulation and data exfiltration. It is written in .NET programming language and specifically targets Windows computer.

njRAT was first discovered in 2012, and Microsoft published the first public report on it in 2014. Microsoft classified it as MSIL/Bladabindi, and named its creation tool VirTool:MSIL/Bladabindi.A also referring it as NJ Rat.

The original njRAT was created by a group called M38dHhM believed to be based in Arabic speaking country, primarily targeting the Middle East. However, after its source code leaked in 2013, multiple modified versions emerged, including:

- njRAT 0.7d Danger Edition
- njRAT 0.7d Golden Edition
- njRAT 0.7d Green Edition
- njRAT Lime Edition

## 2. Attack Simulation

In this analysis, the njRAT variation used is njRAT Green Edition. The njRAT creator can be accessed publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/XAKEP-1lly/NjRat-0.7D-Green-Edition-by-im523). A lab consists of 2 _Windows 10_ virtual machines, acting as an attacker and victim will be used to demonstrate the njRAT malware. The lab setup is as follow:

![Figure 1 Lab configuration](assets/img/blogs/01/01.png)

Figure 1 Lab configuration

Attacker

OS: Windows 10

IP: 10.0.0.10

Victim

OS: Windows 10 (Flare VM installed)

IP: 10.0.0.11

### 2.1. njRAT creation

Upon running the njRAT creator, a pop-pup window will appear, where listening port for the command and control (C2) server (attacker machine) can be set.

![Figure 2 Pop-up window to set listening port – Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/02.png)

Figure 2 Pop-up window to set listening port – Attacker machine

Clicking on _Builder_ button on the lower left corner will pop-up a window for njRAT creation where a few options and parameters can be set.  Some important parameters are:

- Host: The public IP of the C2 server
- Port: The listening port of the C2 server
- Hidden: Set the file attribute of the malware to hidden.Registry StartUp: Create an entry at a location.
- Copy to StartUp: It will copy itself to windows startup folder.
- Protect Process [BSOD]: If the process is terminated, it will result in Blue Screen of Death.
- Anti Kill: Disable keyboard or mouse input if certain process is running.
- Usb Spread: Copies the malware to program files on every logical drives.

![Figure 3 Pop-up window to create njRAT - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/03.png)

Figure 3 Pop-up window to create njRAT - Attacker machine

Clicking on _Build_ button, the executable file can be created with supplied name (in this case it is named Server.exe).

![Figure 4 Saving crafted njRAT - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/04.png)

Figure 4 Saving crafted njRAT - Attacker machine

### 2.2. njRAT Distribution

njRAT can be distributed in many ways. Some of the attack vectors recorded are :

- Phishing email: njRAT is sent as a malicious attachment.
- Discord spam.
- Mail spam of shipment tracking with Zip file attachment.
- Cloud based storage.
- Compromised website that trick user into downloading fake update.

The general goal is for the crafted njRAT executable file to be executed on victim’s machine, either by directly double clicking the executable file, or by using Visual Basic Script (VBS) for automated execution.

![Figure 5 C2 GUI shows list of infected machine(s) - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/05.png)

Figure 5 C2 GUI shows list of infected machine(s) - Attacker machine

Upon execution by victim, the C2 graphical user interface (GUI) will show list of infected machines.

![Figure 6 Victim's machine POV - Victim machine](assets/img/blogs/01/06.png)

Figure 6 Victim's machine POV - Victim machine

From the point of view of the victim, nothing is changed.

### 2.3. njRAT exploitation

Right clicking on the victim on the list will reveal list of exploitations that can be executed. Some interesting exploitations are:

![Figure 7 Different exploitations choice - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/07.png)

Figure 7 Different exploitations choice - Attacker machine

Manager

Attacker can view, edit or execute items from _File manager, Process Manager, Connections, Registry, Remote Shell Services._

![Figure 8 Manager - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/08.png)

![Figure 12 Keylogger ability - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/12.png)

Figure 12 Keylogger ability - Attacker machine

Chat

Attacker can initiate conversation with the victim via a chat box.

![Figure 13 Attacker can communicate with victim via chat - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/13.png)

Figure 13 Attacker can communicate with victim via chat - Attacker machine

![Figure 14 Victim can communicate with attacker via a chat box - Victim machine](assets/img/blogs/01/14.png)

Figure 14 Victim can communicate with attacker via a chat box - Victim machine

Some other exploits are:

- Remote cam: open victim’s webcam
- Remote DDoS: Use victim’s machine to initiate a DoS attack
- Microphone: Listen to victim’s microphone
- Get Passwords: Grab victim’s password
- Fun: Do vicious things on victim’s machine such as hide cursor, turn off monitor, and text-to-speech.

## 3. Static Analysis

Static analysis is conducted on the crafted njRAT executable file, and FlareVM is used as the sandbox.

### 3.1. Overview inspection using pestudio

Opening the executable file on pestudio, several important information are gathered:

- It is a 32-bit executable file (MZ file signature).
- It is written on .NET (dnspy can be used to analyse the source code) architecture.

![Figure 15 pestudio](assets/img/blogs/01/15.png)

Figure 15 pestudio

Analyzing strings listed by the pestudio, some interesting ones are:

- [https://dl.dropbox.com/s/p84aaz28t0hepul/Pass.exe?dl=0](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/p84aaz28t0hepul/Pass.exe?dl=0)
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System
- HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SystemRestore
- netsh firewall add allowedprogram
- netsh firewall delete allowedprogram
- shutdowncomputer
- restartcomputer
- logoff
- DisableTaskMgr

Based on these strings, a few guesses on what the malware is capable of can be made; It can modify the registry, shut down the computer, disable task manager, and modify firewall policies.

### 3.2. Code analysis using dnspy

Since the malware was created using .NET framework, the malware itself was not compiled into machine language, but it is compiled into intermediary language (IL) that preserves class names, method names, and variable names. Hence it is possible to decompile and analyze the source code using tools like dnspy, ILSpy, or dotPeek.

The entry point of njRAT is _main()_ function

![Figure 16 Entry point is main function](assets/img/blogs/01/16.png)

Figure 16 Entry point is main function

_main()_ function will call _OK.ko()_ function

![Figure 17 main() function will call OK.ko() function](assets/img/blogs/01/17.png)

Figure 17 main() function will call OK.ko() function

It will first create a Mutex to ensure that only one instance of it is running. If the mutex creation failed, therefore if another instance of it is running, the current instance will stop.

![Figure 18 Ok.ko() will create a Mutex](assets/img/blogs/01/18.png)

Figure 18 Ok.ko() will create a Mutex

OK.INS()

After the Mutex creation, it will call _OK.INS()_ function, that will initiate malware installation process*.* In _OK.INS()_ function, if the _copy_ option was selected during njRAT creation, it will check the current path of the executable with the path that was specified during the creation. If it does not match, it will copy the executable file to the specified path, run it, and stop the current instance.

![Figure 19 Copying executable to the specified location](assets/img/blogs/01/19.png)

Figure 19 Copying executable to the specified location

Then it will modify the firewall rule to add itself as a permitted program.

![assets/img/blogs/01/20.png)

Figure 20 Add firewall rule to allow itself to run

If _RegistryStarUP_ option was selected during njRAT creation, it will add a new entry under _CurrentUser_ at _Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run_ with value of current path of the executable. It will make the executable runs automatically on every user login.

![Figure 21 Function to add registry entry](assets/img/blogs/01/21.png)

Figure 21 Function to add registry entry

![Figure 22 New registry entry is added by the malware on victim machine](assets/img/blogs/01/22.png)

Figure 22 New registry entry is added by the malware on victim machine

If _Hidden_ and _Copy to StartUp_ option was selected during njRAT creation, the executable file properties will be set to hidden, hence it will not be visible from file explorer by default. It will also be copied to the startup folder _C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup_

![Figure 23 Function to set file attribute to hidden and copy the file to startup folder](assets/img/blogs/01/23.png)

Figure 23 Function to set file attribute to hidden and copy the file to startup folder

![Figure 24 The attribute is set to hidden](assets/img/blogs/01/24.png)

Figure 24 The attribute is set to hidden

![Figure 25 The executable file is copied to startup folder](assets/img/blogs/01/25.png)

Figure 25 The executable file is copied to startup folder

If Kill Process option was selected, it will kill the specified process

![Figure 26 Function to kill specified process](assets/img/blogs/01/26.png)

Figure 26 Function to kill specified process

If _USB spread_ was selected during njRAT creation, then it will scan each logical drives with that has _Program Files_ folder, and it will copy itself into the folder with its name as specified during the creation. It will also create an _autorun.inf_  file in the same folder and writes its content as:

```bash
[autorun]
Open = <Program_Files_Folder_Path>/<Malware_Executable_Name>
Shellexecute= <Program_Files_Folder_Path>
```

When the infected drive is attached to any machine, Windows will automatically run the _autorun.inf_ and compromise the machine with njRAT.

OK.RC()

Upon completion of installation function _OK.INS()_ the malware will start a new thread and initiate connection with the C2 server using _OK.RC()_ function, which most probably stands for Remote Connection or Remote Control.

![Figure 27 OK.RC() function is called to handle connection with C2 server](assets/img/blogs/01/27.png)

Figure 27 OK.RC() function is called to handle connection with C2 server

It will initiate connection with C2 server via IP address (defined as OK.HH)

![Figure 28 Initiating connection with C2 server via IP address](assets/img/blogs/01/28.png)

Figure 28 Initiating connection with C2 server via IP address

Every action from the C2 server (hide task manager, open webcam, remote desktop, etc) will be sent as a string and it will be used to execute any functions defined under _OK.IND()_. All the core functionalities of njRAT is defined under this function.

![Figure 29 OK.IND() function where all the core function of njRAT is defined](assets/img/blogs/01/29.png)

Figure 29 OK.IND() function where all the core function of njRAT is defined

OK.wrk()

OK.WRK() function is responsible for keylogging features of njRAT

![Figure 30 OK.WRK() function for keylogging features](assets/img/blogs/01/30.png)

Figure 30 OK.WRK() function for keylogging features

OK.mgr.protect

If _Anti Kill_ option is set during njRAT creation, it will continuously checks if process _taskmgr, processviewer, processhacker, process explorer_ is running, it will disable keyboard or mouse input to it and end the processes.

![Figure 31 OK.mgr.protect() function as a protection  mechanism](assets/img/blogs/01/31.png)

Figure 31 OK.mgr.protect() function as a protection  mechanism

OK.pr()

If _Protect Process [BSOD]_ option _was selected during njRAT creation_, _OK.pr()_ function will be executed. It will set the malware’s ProcessInformationClass to 29, which will categorize the process as critical. Since it is categorized as critical, any attempt to disrupt its operation will results in if the execution of the malware is interrupted, it will result in blue screen of death (BSOD).

![Figure 32 OK.pr() function will set ProcessInformationClass to 29](assets/img/blogs/01/32.png)

Figure 32 OK.pr() function will set ProcessInformationClass to 29

## 4. Dynamic analysis

Dynamic analysis is conducted on the crafted njRAT executable file, and FlareVM is used as the sandbox.

### 4.1. System Behaviour Analysis

When the malware was executed on victim machine (double click on _Server.exe_ file), nothing seem to happen on the victim machine, the cursor will turns into a loading icon for a few seconds, then it will be back to normal.

![Figure 34 Malware is executed (double click on Server.exe) – Victim machine](assets/img/blogs/01/34.png)

Figure 34 Malware is executed (double click on Server.exe) – Victim machine

On the attacker’s end, when the victim executed the malware, a notification will appear (with evil laughing sound effect) at the bottom right corner listing the victim’s IP address, the machine name, the user name, the OS, the country, and the njRAT version. The compromised machine(s) will be listed on the main page of the C2 interface.

![Figure 35 Notification on the bottom right corner when new machine is compromised – Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/35.png)

Figure 35 Notification on the bottom right corner when new machine is compromised – Attacker machine

![Figure 36 Compromised machine(s) are listed on the main page - Attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/36.png)

Figure 36 Compromised machine(s) are listed on the main page - Attacker machine

Since _RegistryStarUP_ option was selected during njRAT cration, a new entry under _CurrentUser_ at _Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run_ with value of current path of the executable will be added on victim machine.

![Figure 37 New registry entry is added by the malware on victim machine](assets/img/blogs/01/37.png)

Figure 37 New registry entry is added by the malware on victim machine

Since _Hidden_ and _Copy to StartUp_ option was selected during njRAT creation, the executable file properties is set to hidden, hence it will not be visible from file explorer by default. It will also be copied to the startup folder _C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup_

![Figure 38 The attribute is set to hidden](assets/img/blogs/01/38.png)

Figure 38 The attribute is set to hidden

![Figure 39 The executable file is copied to startup folder](assets/img/blogs/01/39.png)

Figure 39 The executable file is copied to startup folder

### 4.2. Network Traffic Analysis (using Wireshark)

Initialization

When the malware is executed, the victim machine will initiate a regular TCP handshake with the attacker machine. \*Note that attacker IP: 10.0.0.10, victim IP: 10.0.0.11

![Figure 40 Victim initialized TCP 3-way handshake with the attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/40.png)

Figure 40 Victim initialized TCP 3-way handshake with the attacker machine

Then the victim machine will send its information to attacker machine in cleartext. The information sent are:

- Victim name set during njRAT creation (base64 encoded)
- Machine name
- Victim name
- Date
- Victim OS

![Figure 41 Victim machine send its information to attacker machine in cleartext](assets/img/blogs/01/41.png)

Figure 41 Victim machine send its information to attacker machine in cleartext

![Figure 42 CyberChef is used to decode base64](assets/img/blogs/01/42.png)

Figure 42 CyberChef is used to decode base64

The victim machine will then send Victim IP and port number; executable file location; executable file name; and list of _True_ and _False_ values corresponding to the options selected during njRAT creation, all are encoded in based64.

![Figure 43 Victim machine send informations to attacker machine](assets/img/blogs/01/43.png)

Figure 43 Victim machine send informations to attacker machine

![Figure 44 Base64 is decoded using cyberchef](assets/img/blogs/01/44.png)

Figure 44 Base64 is decoded using cyberchef

Keylogger

When attacker click on keylogger function, it sends _kl_ command, victim machine then will send the log containing captured keystrokes

![Figure 45 Attacker send "kl" command to victim](assets/img/blogs/01/45.png)

Figure 45 Attacker send "kl" command to victim

![Figure 46 Log sent by victim machine decoded using CyberChef](assets/img/blogs/01/46.png)

Figure 46 Log sent by victim machine decoded using CyberChef

Remote Desktop

Live feed of victim’s desktop is sent as a stream of TCP packets.

![Figure 47 TCP streams of victim's desktop live feed](assets/img/blogs/01/47.png)

Figure 47 TCP streams of victim's desktop live feed
